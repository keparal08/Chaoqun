# Hi! ðŸ¤”

This is my personal website, built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com/) and [UnoCSS](https://github.com/antfu/unocss).
Before this, I used [this one](https://kepavel.github.io/) for my personal web.

Anyway, just have fun: [keparal](https://www.keparal.cn/)
